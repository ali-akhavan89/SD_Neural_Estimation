Drift d=
	RANDOM UNIFORM(-1, 1, Noise Seed ns)

Shock K=
	RANDOM NORMAL(-10000, 10000, 0, Process Noise Standard Deviation σp, Noise Seed ns)
	~	1/Time
	~	Shock represents random perturbations affecting the system's state at each \
		time step, modeled as normally distributed with a mean of zero and a given \
		standard deviation.
	|

Measurement Noise Standard Deviation σm=
	0.1
	~	Dmnl
	~	The standard deviation of measurement noise quantifies the variability in \
		observations of the system's state due to measurement errors.
	|

Initial State S0=
	RANDOM UNIFORM(0, 10, Noise Seed ns)
	~	Dmnl
	~	The initial state is set randomly within a specified range, serving as the \
		starting point for the system's state evolution.
	|

Process Noise Standard Deviation σp=
	0.5
	~	1/Time
	~	This parameter indicates the variability in the process noise, reflecting \
		the unpredictable external factors affecting the system's evolution.
	|

Noise Seed ns=
	2
	~	Dmnl
	~	The noise seed specifies the particular pseudo-random number stream that \
		affects measurement and process noise standard deviations.

" "= INTEG (
	Change in State ΔS,
		Initial State S0)
	~	Dmnl
	~	The current state of the system is determined by the initial state and the \
		cumulative effect of changes over time.

State Observed SObs=
	" "*RANDOM NORMAL(0, 2 , 1 , Measurement Noise Standard Deviation σm , Noise Seed ns\
		)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The observed state is the true state affected by normally distributed \
		measurement noise, representing the imperfect real-world observation of \
		the system's state.
	~	:SUPPLEMENTARY 
	|

Change in State ΔS=
	Drift d+Shock K
	~	1/Time
	~	Change in state is the sum of the drift and shock at each time step, \
		indicating the system's incremental evolution.
