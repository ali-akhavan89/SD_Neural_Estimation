		)
	~	dmnl
	~	This variable models the impact of public perception of the death rate on \
		the disease's attack rate. It uses a function that inversely relates the \
		attack rate to the perceived death rate, adjusted by the public's \
		sensitivity to death and a diminishing factor. This function reflects how \

		reduce the disease's transmission potential.

	~	1/Day
	~	This variable represents the attack rate of the disease as influenced by \
		both the inherent transmission intensity and the modifying effect of \
		public perception of risk. It is calculated by multiplying the baseline \
		transmission intensity of the disease by the factor that adjusts for how \
		public perception of death risk impacts the disease's spread.
